# Usage Instruction
Navigate to the `bin/` directory and choose the platform you are currently on.

Run both the frontend executable and the backend executable.

We only implemented the server to run only on `localhost:7681` by default, so
enter that value as the IP address in the frontend, and you are good to go.
